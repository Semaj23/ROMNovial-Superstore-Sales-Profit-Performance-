## Dashboard Components, Observations & Recommendations

### 1. Average Profit per Order by Sub-Category
**Observation**: 'Markers' deliver the highest average profit per order, while 'Bookcases' contribute the least.

**Recommendation**: Expand sales strategies around high-margin items like Markers and Printers. Reassess pricing or sourcing strategies for Bookcases.

### 2. Monthly Sales Trend
**Observation**: Sales show fluctuations, with noticeable spikes and drops across different periods.

**Recommendation**: Investigate seasonal or promotional events tied to high-performing months. Implement demand forecasting models for better inventory planning.

### 3. Payment Mode Analysis
**Observation**: Debit Card is the most used payment method, followed by Credit Card and UPI.

**Recommendation**: Incentivize preferred digital payment modes and optimize checkouts for these channels to increase conversion.

### 4. Top Customers by Sales
**Observation**: Cory Evans leads as the top customer, followed closely by Nicholas Anderson and Emily Ellison.

**Recommendation**: Consider loyalty programs or targeted marketing for top spenders to boost retention and advocacy.

### 5. Product Quantity Sold by Category
**Observation**: Furniture and Office Supplies have nearly equal share, with Electronics slightly behind.

**Recommendation**: Cross-sell electronics with office products; bundle packages to increase average cart size.

### 6. Top 5 Performing Cities by Profit
**Observation**: Orlando dominates in profit contribution, nearly doubling that of other cities.

**Recommendation**: Investigate factors behind Orlando's performance—such as demographics or promotions—and replicate success in lower-performing cities.

### 7. Quantity Sold per City
**Observation**: Buffalo and San Francisco have the highest sales volume in quantity, though not necessarily highest profit.

**Recommendation**: Monitor cost margins in these regions and promote profitable product mixes to optimize value per unit sold.
